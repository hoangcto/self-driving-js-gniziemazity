# self-driving-js-gniziemazity

This is the code I wrote following the Self-driving car (no libraries) JavaScript course by @gniziemazity:

The code will appear as the course progresses and will be divided into parts as follows:
  1. Car driving mechanics 
  2. Road definition
  3. Artificial sensors
  4. Collision detection
  5. Traffic simulation 
  6. Neural network 
  7. Visualizing neural networks 
  8. Optimizing neural networks
  9. Fine-tuning
